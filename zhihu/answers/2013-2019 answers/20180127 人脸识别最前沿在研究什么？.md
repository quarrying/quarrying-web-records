最近在做人脸识别相关的工作, 比较关注这方面的学术动态. 发现对人脸识别的 Loss 函数改进的论文比较多, 如:

[2017] L2-constrained Softmax Loss for Discriminative Face Verification

[2017 ACM MM] NormFace_ L2 Hypersphere Embedding for Face Verification

[2017 CVPR] SphereFace_ Deep Hypersphere Embedding for Face Recognition
(A_Softmax Loss)

[2017 NIPS] Rethinking Feature Discrimination and Polymerization for Large-
scale Recognition (COCO Loss)

[2017 ICCV] Deep Metric Learning with Angular Loss

[2017] Contrastive-center loss for deep neural networks

[2017 CVPR] Range Loss for Deep Face Recognition with Long-tail

2018年伊始也出几两篇相关改进的论文:

[2018] Additive Margin Softmax for Face Verification

[2018] Face Recognition via Centralized Coordinate Learning

[2018] ArcFace_ Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep Face Recognition

  

人脸识别还有一些其他难点和热点的, 比如

1) 基于视频的人脸识别

[2017 CVPR] Neural Aggregation Network for Video Face Recognition;

[2017 PAMI] Trunk-Branch Ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks for Video-
based Face Recognition

2) 三维人脸识别

[2017] Deep 3D Face Identification

[2017] Learning from Millions of 3D Scans for Large-scale 3D Face Recognition

3) 跨年龄的人脸识别

[2017 PRL] Large Age-Gap face verification by feature injection in deep
networks

[2017] Cross-Age LFW_ A Database for Studying Cross-Age Face Recognition in
Unconstrained Environments

4) 少样本人脸识别

[2017] One-shot Face Recognition by Promoting Underrepresented Classes;

[2017] SSPP-DAN_ Deep Domain Adaptation Network for Face Recognition with
Single Sample Per Person

5) 遮挡情况下的人脸识别

[2017 ICCVW] Disguised Face Identification (DFI) with Facial KeyPoints using
Spatial Fusion Convolutional Network

[2017] Enhancing Convolutional Neural Networks for Face Recognition with
Occlusion Maps and Batch Triplet Loss

6) 多模型特征融合

[2017 PAMI] Face Search at Scale

[2017] Deep Heterogeneous Feature Fusion for Template-Based Face Recognition

还有注意到现在人脸识别的评价方式逐渐转向更贴近实用的 1:N 的开集测试([2017 CVPRW] Toward Open Set Face Recognition).
